# Tips for Writing Effective Glazier Configs

*   YAML supports comments. Use them to delinate/decorate config blocks as well
    as communicating intent or documenting bugs/TODOs.

*   Some parts of configs are strictly ordered and others are not. The top
    level, implemented as an ordered list, will always happen in sequence. Be
    careful not to assume strict ordering in other parts of the config,
    particularly where the YAML is dictionary typed. When in doubt, use two top
    level config elements to assert order of operations.

    *   You can also achieve ordering with list-based types, such as templates
        and includes.

*   Use includes to batch together a series of commands all affected by the same
    Pins. Rather than applying the same Pins to each of a series of configs, put
    the entire series in a separate file. Then apply the shared Pin(s) to the
    include statement that references the new config file.

*   Use includes and directory structure to break up the configuration flow in a
    logical way. Everything could live in one file and directory if you wanted
    it to, but it would be ugly and hard to read.

*   It's easier to cherrypick changes from separate files. Consider separating
    out elements that are frequently changed for easier management across
    branches.
